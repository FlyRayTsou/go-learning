# File Descriptor

On macOS, the following file descriptors are defined:

```
File Descriptor	Name	Description
0	STDIN_FILENO	Standard input (stdin)
1	STDOUT_FILENO	Standard output (stdout)
2	STDERR_FILENO	Standard error (stderr)
3 to 63		Unused file descriptors, available for applications to use
64 to 127		Used by the system for various purposes
128 to MAX_FD		Available for applications to use
```

MAX_FD is a macro that defines the maximum allowed file descriptor number, which is typically 1024.

It's worth noting that file descriptor numbers may differ between systems, so it's always best to refer to the system documentation for the specific operating system you are working on.
